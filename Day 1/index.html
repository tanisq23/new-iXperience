            I am a sophomore studying computer science at Boston University.
            Although I originally entered college as a business major, I made
            the switch to computer science after taking a couple of classes and
            developing an interest in it.

                  I have been playing tennis since I was 5 years old. I spent
                  the last 3 years of high school at a tennis academy in France,
                  and eventually got recruited to play Division 1 tennis for
                  Boston University, which I did for my freshman year.
